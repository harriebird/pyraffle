# pyraffle

A simple raffle notebook. This is initially made for the raffle in the Software Freedom Day Bukidnon 2025. This was made compatible with Luma guest list.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment using the command `python -m venv venv` and activate it. 
3. Install the requirements using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Make a copy of the file `settings.py.example` and name it `settings.py`.
5. Download the guest list from Luma. Copy it inside the project directory and name it `guests.csv`.
6. Run the JupyterLab using the command `jupyter lab`.
7. Open the `pyraffle.ipynb` notebook and let the raffle begin! :)
